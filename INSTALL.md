# Released raw data
We release the following datasets and tool under the MIT License:

* Decca, our dependency issue assessment tool, which is implemented as a Maven plugin to warn developers whether the issues are benign or harmful. You can download it via https://github.com/DeccaDC/RawData, which contains the following files and directories:

> (1) File **decca-1.0.jar** is a copy of Decca‘s implementation for running analysis tasks.

> (2)	File **decca-1.0.pom** is the pom file (project object model) of Decca project.

> (3)	File **soot-1.0.jar** is a program static analysis tool referenced by Decca.

> (4)	The directory **apache-maven-3.2.5** is the Maven project. As Decca is a Maven plugin, its implementation depends on Maven project.

> (5)	File **script.jar** is the script for evaluating the experimental results shown in Section 5.1. With the help of this script, analyzing the ground truth dataset can be run in batch mode.

*	Raw data we used in our experiments(Section 5). You can find raw datasets in package **RawData.zip** which is available at:
https://we.tl/PiShDzvpaF 

The package **RawData.zip** contains the following two parts of data:

> (a)	The ground truth dataset used to verify the effectiveness of Decca (Section 5.1). You can find it in package **RawData\Ground truth dataset.zip**, which contains the following files and directories:

>>(1)	File **Ground truth dataset.xlsx** provides the explanation for the dataset.

>>(2)	The directory **RawData\Release_conflict** contains the collected host projects with 43 high-severity and 176 low-severity dependency issues.

>>(3)	The directory **RawData\Release_fixed** contains the above host projects whose high- severity dependency issues have been fixed.
Running Decca on **RawData\Release_conflict** and **RawData\Release_fixed** can reproduce our experimental results described in Section 5.1.

> (b)	24 Java projects we analyzed to verify the usefulness of Decca (Section 5.2). In package **RawData\Issue report dataset.zip**, you can find the following files and directories:

>>(1)	File Issue report **dataset\Reports.docx** lists the links of dependency conflict issue reports we submitted to their corresponding bug tracking systems(in Section 5.2).

>>(2)	The directory **Issue report dataset\Projects** contains the 24 subjects with dependency conflict issues.

>>(3)	The directory **Issue report dataset\Generated issue reports** contains the issue reports generated by Decca.

Running Decca on them can reproduce our experimental results described in Table 3 of Section 5.2.

# How to use Decca
Decca can take a Maven based project (it should contain the complete Maven built project directory and file pom.xml) as input for analysis. The expected running environment is 64-bit Window operating system with JDK 1.7 or 1.8. **As Maven built projects need to download dependencies from Maven Central Repository, Decca cannot work offline.**

You can run Decca on our experimental subjects based on the following steps:

**Step 1**: Unzip the plugin-decca.zip to local directory. Recommended directory structure is:

>> D:\plugin-decca
     
>>     ├─decca-1.0.jar : 
     
>>     ├─decca-1.0.pom
   
>>     ├─soot-1.0.jar
    
>>     ├─apache-maven-3.2.5
   
>>     ├─script.jar

*Note: To facilitate testing, please keep the unzip directory to be consistent with the above example. It should be noted that the location of data (e.g, D:\plugin-decca) is not hardcoded, it can be replaced with user's actual unzip directory in the install commands.*

**Step 2**: Install Decca

(a) Execute the following Windows CMD command to install soot:

>> D:\plugin-decca\apache-maven-3.2.5\bin\mvn.bat install:install-file  -Dfile=D:\plugin-decca\soot-1.0.jar  -DgroupId=neu.lab  -DartifactId=soot -Dversion=1.0 -Dpackaging=jar

(b) Execute the following Windows CMD command to install Decca:

>> D:\plugin-decca\apache-maven-3.2.5\bin\mvn.bat install:install-file  -Dfile=D:\plugin-decca\decca-1.0.jar  -DgroupId=neu.lab  -DartifactId=decca -Dversion=1.0 -Dpackaging=maven-plugin -DpomFile=D:\plugin-decca\decca-1.0.pom

**Step 3**: Detect and assess the dependency conflict issues.

Execute the following Windows CMD command to analyze the project:

>>D:\plugin-decca\apache-maven-3.2.5\bin\mvn.bat -f=D:\RawData\Issue report dataset\Projects\hadoop-rel-release-3.0.0\hadoop-common-project\hadoop-minikdc\pom.xml -Dmaven.test.skip=true neu.lab:decca:1.0:detect -DresultFilePath=D:\Report\resultFile.xml -DdetectClass=true -e –Dappend=false –e

Then you can get the dependency issue report in your specified directory (e.g., **D:\Report\resultFile.xml**).

>>> **Command explanation:**
>>>>(1) -f=pom file : Specify the project under analysis;

>>>>(2) -DresultFilePath=output issue report directory : Output the issue report to the specified file;

>>>>(3) -DdetectClass=Boolean : Specify the tool whether reports the class level conflicts or not;

>>>>(4) -Dappend=Boolean : Specify the result output mode (whether in append mode or not).
